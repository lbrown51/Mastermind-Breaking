Project 1

Stuff Does : 
	The idea for this game is to think of a mastermind code and have the computer break
your code. I am pretty sure that this doesn't work, but most of the methods are pretty okay.
You input your colors on the first menu, then a guess is presented. You then comment on the 
blacks (right color, right place) and whites (right color, wrong place). Then the game messes
up. Which is pretty annoying. I hope you enjoy it. Watching it generate lots of permutations is
pretty satisfying.
Contents : 6 java files file as requested, readme, output. mainMastermind has the main method 
in it. You should compile from there I'm pretty sure.
